These are my current screens with some details about each.

**UPDATE**

As you know, Home Assistant is a *rabbit hole*, a *time sink*. So I've added more components which means I need to update the screens.

=== "Home"

    ![Home](../images/HA-Dashboard-Screenshots/living-room.webp){: loading=lazy }
    The Living room part of my Home dashboard.


=== "System Stats"

    ![Stats](../images/HA-Dashboard-Screenshots/stats.webp){: loading=lazy }
    Random stats about my Home Assistant instance and automations. I soon plan on setting up InfluxDB, Glances, and Grafana but that is for another time.


=== "Media"

    ![Media](../images/HA-Dashboard-Screenshots/media.webp){: loading=lazy }
    My second pride and joy, my home theater room dashboard. Still working on it, but it has all my gaming, TV, and music related interests on it.

    I am working on setting up <a href="https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-tautulli/blob/main/README.md">Tautulli</a> for managing my Plex server. I am also thinking about migrating the server to dedicated hardware and not on my Mac Mini.

=== "Energy Usage"

    ![Energy](../images/HA-Dashboard-Screenshots/energy.webp){: loading=lazy }
    Seeing as I am only a renter of this townhouse, I can't really put any devices on the meter to monitor my energy usage but what I <em>can</em> do is use smart plugs and devices that natively monitor energy usage.

=== "Wall Kiosk"

    ![Kiosk](../images/HA-Dashboard-Screenshots/wall-kiosk.webp){: loading=lazy }
    This kiosk is in progress, but I'm going to mount it in the hallway so that when I walk in, I can monitor the cameras throughout the house and disarm the alarm. When I leave I can also start/stop a vacuum session as well.

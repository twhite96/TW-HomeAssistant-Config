!!!danger "Beware of changes"
    I constantly improve my home. It evolves as I add new devices and services. It's changing as my daily routines are changing.

    Please, keep in mind **this documentation might be outdated** in covering some details. However, I'll try my best to keep this updated.

## Lost and don't know where to start?

The best way to discover new ideas and inspire is by [reading the code][github-url], copying-pasting parts of my configuration and adjusting it to your needs.

Read this documentation to see the bigger picture:

[Hardware](./hardware){: .md-button }
[Software](./Software/overview){: .md-button }
[Home Assistant](./HomeAssistant/introduction){: .md-button }
[Resources](./resources){: .md-button }


## Motivation

I write this documentation for two main reasons:

1. **To keep track of growing my smart home.** To maintain an understanding of how things are working.
2. **To help other enthusiasts inspire.** People often ask about my smart home setup. Now I can give them a link to this documentation, instead of explaining everything once again.

## Limitations

I'm renting my townhouse. My landlord handles fixing stuff in my home, covering all the expenses. The only downside is that I can only change certain things in my home such as lighting, CCTV, and garage door automations. YMMV.

## Future Plans

I have a [public Notion board][notion] with ideas and tasks for my smart home. You can follow and comment my plans there.

# System Overview

This page describes my system setup. Here you can find software I rely on for running my smart home system.

## Home Assistant OS

This is the main software I use on my NUC. It was my first setup and is my favorite. It is beginning to grow in size, backups are around 36gb so I am beginning to test the Docker configuration, though I don't intend to work with it completely as the add-on store is so useful.

### Docker

I am experimenting with Docker on my Synology. Check out the [Docker](docker.md) for a list of my containers.

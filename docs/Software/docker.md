# Docker Containers

I've moved all of my Docker containers to Proxmox VMs, which you can check out on the [Proxmox](../proxmox) page!


!!!note Update
    I am running a small server farm in my house, and in an effort to redesign my dashboards, I wanted to run another version of Home Assistant on a headless server running in Docker. This meant that I had to learn more about HA Supervised. Since digging into how that works, I am debating whether I should move my whole system to a Docker install running HA Supervised.

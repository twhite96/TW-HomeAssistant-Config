# External Access

I am currently paying for [Nabu Casa](https://www.nabucasa.com/) and for a quick and dirty external access solution it is well worth of the $6.


## Former (often hacky) solutions

Last year when I started this project, Home Assistant was a different animal entirely. So I tried to hack together [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) as a proxy so that I could access Home Assistant remotely. Back then, I was new to networking and Home Assistant, and I *know* I screwed it up. Even so, the tools then were primative to the ones we have now.

# Hardware

## Home Server

!!!info "Info"
    You can get most of the main hardware cheaply; my NUC cost 
    under $500. The performance benefit is worth the price alone.

     Here is a photo of the main device running Home Assistant proper, an Intel NUC.

    Using TP-Link switches and UniFi Dream Machine Pro to manage my home network. I need an AP just haven't bought one yet. Then I can manage the wifi in the UniFi Network App.<br />

    I'm using a Synology 920+.

    I've archived some images and videos on it but I've also got Docker containers as well as VMM running Home Assistant.

### Raspberry Pi 4

I've since moved onto a NUC but I am thinking of using this as an IR relay or something.

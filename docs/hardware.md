# Hardware

This is the list of all hardware that is present in my smart house.

## Computers

### Intel NUC BXKit10i3

At first, the Raspberry Pi 4 was a capable machine; everything was fast and snappy.

Fast forward a year, a new house, more cameras and components, and that same Raspberry Pi has become sluggish as I add more add-ons and HACS custom components.

So I bought this NUC and am working with it now. I made sure UEFI Boot mode is enabled and Secure Boot disabled.

It's super late so I'll get this up and running and report back on [my blog](https://suburbansmarts.org) tomorrow or later this week.

### Raspberry Pi 4

I've since moved onto a NUC but I am thinking of using this as an IR relay or something.
